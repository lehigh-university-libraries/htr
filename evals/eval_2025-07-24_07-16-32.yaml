        Nathaniel Cutting Esq.

        Sir, It is not more than ten minutes since
        I have heard a very extraordinary letter of yours to Mr.
        Fairfax read to the House of assembly in this city, the
        whole of which is false and malignant, evidently done
        and with premeditation and care to injure me and
        gratify Horton, Fairfax and other of my personal
        enemies; you state positively that I pirated Mr.
        Cartwright’s rope machine and sold it to you as
        wholly my own, this is untrue. I always informed
        you that Mr. Cartwright had made such a machine
        I introduced you to him by letter, would a pirate
        wishing to conceal his fraud, have done so? I
        made one from memory with some alterations,
        the laws of France permitted patents for imported
        inventions, you were to give me something for it,
        I lent you in your distress more than I ever
        received, but if you had reason to complain of
        this transaction why not do it to me within the
        last two years? You say I received from Aaron
        Vail Fitch’s papers and had them for several
        months and that you can well believe it because

This is malignant to the highest degree and as false as it is base. I never saw a paper of Mr. Fitch until I saw his papers in the office at Washington in 1807, but if I had seen all his papers, which he ever had, with his specifications and drawings such as I have never seen in the possession of Mr. Harford, they could lead me nothing. Mr. Fitch knew nothing, he was mad. Thornton who about as mad I have never seen the collected and united efforts of Ogden, Harford, Thornton and Delacy with your aid to destroy me. I have seen in fancy colors your embossed workshops and fortunately for me your mockups, the evidence of Fitch's bankruptcy, his own ending and confessing he was mad had no service but one exalted scientific idea of a steamboat and acknowledged his failure. But for I despise your efforts and those of the miserable ephemeral train whom envy and malice urge on to attack me. What courts induce you to enter these ranks of injustice I cannot conceive. I always treated you with friendship and certainly I have at times relieved your pressing wants, you have stepped forth and improved works to be my enemy. I accept the war. I defy you or any living being to stain my character with"

        My dear Sir

        I am going to Washington tomorrow morning
        With some hope to get the patent laws so minded
        as to protect mental property or diminish
        Lawsuits, you will much oblige me by a letter
        or letter to any of your influential friends
        who are friendly to science and the
        improvement of our country. I know
        Mr. Lloyd, but to Mr. Denney and
        Quincy an introduction is necessary
        If you will please not to mention
        this project of mine, I will have
        the pleasure of calling on you this
        evening. Respectfully your most
        obedient Rob. Fulton

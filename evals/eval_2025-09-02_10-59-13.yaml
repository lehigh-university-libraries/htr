        Nathaniel Cutting Esq.

        Sir, It is not more than ten minutes since
        I have heard a very extraordinary letter of yours to Mr.
        Fairfax read to the House of assembly in this city, the
        whole of which is false and malignant, evidently done
        and with premeditation and care to injure me and
        gratify Horton, Fairfax and their, I may say our
        enemies; you state positively that I private, Mr.
        Cartwright’s fire machine and sold it to you as
        wholly my own, this is untrue. I always informed
        you that Mr. Cartwright had made such a machine
        I introduced you to him by letter, would a private
        wishing to conceal his fraud, have done so? I
        made one from memory with some alterations,
        the laws of France permitted patents for improvements
        inventions, you were to give me something for it,
        I lent you in your distress, more than I ever
        received, but if you had reason to complain of
        this transaction why not do it to me within the
        last two years? You say I received from Aaron
        Vail Fitch’s papers and had them for several
        months and that you can well believe it, because

This is malignant to the highest degree and as false as it is base. I never saw a paper of Mr. Fitch until I saw his papers in the office at Washington in 1807, but if I had seen all his papers, which he ever had, with his specifications and drawings such as I have never seen in the possession of Mr. Harriott, they could lead me nothing. Mr. Fitch never wrote to me, nor Thornton and about my mind I have never seen the collected and united efforts of Ogden, Harriott, Thornton and Delacy with your aid to destroy me. I have seen in fancy colors your embossed workshops and fortunately for me your mockups, the evidence of Fitch's bankruptcy, his own writing and confession he was mad, had no science, not one exact scientific idea of a steamboat and acknowledged his failure. But for I despise your efforts and those of the miserable ephemeral train whom envy and malice urge on to attack me. What could induce you to enter those ranks of injustice I cannot conceive. I always treated you with friendship and certainly I have at times relieved your pressing wants, you have stepped forth and improved to be my enemy. I accept the war.

        Dear Sir

        Paris June 16. 1786

        Since the receipt of your favor of May 21. I have been in
        daily expectation of receiving from you a particular state of the
        cost of my press &c. mr Paradise wrote me that it was about
        five guineas, but I knew there would still be some addition.
        the moment you will be so good as to favor me with this infor-
        mation I will remit you a bill for that & the eight guineas
        I formerly took the liberty of drawing on you for. in addition
        to this I must give you another piece of trouble. that is to desire
        mr Woodmason, on my part, to send me a copying press (such
        as the one he sent me before) with spare springs, dampning books, dry-
        ing boxes complete, three ream of copying paper & a stock of inkpa-
        der proportioned to that. this he must direct to me & send to
        the care of mr Garvey in Rouen, sending me a bill of the cost
        which I will remit immediately, unless he should prefer drawing
        on me, in which case his draught shall be paid on sight.
        If you have any news from America it will be very acceptable.
        I have received no journals of Congress of later date than Oct. 10. nor
        letter from the office for foreign affairs of later date than January.
        there is a violent contest arisen here between the king & parliament of
        Bordeaux. their papers are public. I will send them to you. Adieu
        my dear Sir
        yours affectionately,

        In spite of your prohibition I do answer your letter, and I return the clippings, for you must be proud of them. It was a fine thing to have a man willing to act as your brother-in-law has acted. It is the kind of thing that is particularly pleasant to me to come across, for, my dear Miss Beaux, I so often see what is mean and sordid in our life that I like to have the good deeds called to my attention too.

        With all thanks,

        Sincerely yours,

        I shall be under the necessity of sending on some Provisions to Johnstown this week, for the Ensuing Month, which obliges me to request you will please forward me on some Beef as soon as possible as I have not more on hand than to serve this Post to the Close of the Month.

        Capt. Dutton informs me that the Number of Men at Johnstown will be increased to between thirty and forty in a few days, so that they will want Beef via Canada, the next Month supply. Lt. Frost the Commanding Officer at that Post writes me he should be glad of having some fresh Meat if it can be obtained, as he has had nothing but salt Provisions for two Months.

        I have made a purchase of 50 Bushells Corn at 4/9 Bushells have bought no Hay as yet but expect in a few days I shall be able to get some as I have a Man to look out for such

        There is great Rumors of a Destruction in the west some
        Still look for foreign intervention but I think that we have
        got our Back to Star at last the North threatens us with
        overwhelming forces & say they will subjugate us in 6 months
        in spite of foreign intervention but I have long since accustomed
        to yankey threat & boasting it does not dishearten me in the least
        it is possible for them to drive us from every point & greatly
        increase our oppression but when they say that they will
        subjugate us they know not what they say for that is a
        thing out of possibility they may determine us to the purpose
        will conquer us I imagine I fear you may think I am trying to
        make a display of my editorial powers but I am just writing
        under my impulse of my feelings I am always long
        letters my dear wife & I expect you will see something
        for them to open my letters I expect they will find something in
        & then be disappointed so I try to still them something in
        my broken & stammering way I fear you have heard
        of our position this winter we have had a very moderate season
        except a few very cold days & some snow storms there has
        been ice here this winter thick enough to run 4 seats upon
        4 & witnessed the first skating in my life this winter it
        was quite a novel to me the snow falls until the first day we have
        moved 2 times since the winter set in we are now in the third
        camp that we have built very inferior winter quarters it
        & just as we were getting them so that we are comfortable in them
        we would have to pack up & move to a new camp we have
        bin poorly fixed for this winter in the way of blankets

        and I want you if you can spare
        the money to send me some
        castor oil, ginger and some of
        Auntie's liniment and send me
        about three pints or two quarts
        of whiskey. I want the whiskey to
        take to strengthen me and kill
        the master with. Just put them
        in a small box and Direct
        them to Capt. J. P. Elliott
        10th Reg Vol Suffolk Va. and do
        not put in anything with them
        that will spoil. Our Regt has
        not got back yet they were
        furlid into the other night
        while on the march and one
        man out of Comp. G. killed dead
        and one wounded. But they have
        had no fighting since but I
        should not wonder if they would
        have a big fight here soon as
        the long talks are all around
        us. I will send you an account

        left them. I wrote to Dave
        on the 3rd and 10th of this month
        and yesterday the letter came back
        with a note from the orderly
        of his Comp. stating that he was
        taken prisoner on the 3rd and
        had been sent to Richmond.

        I must close as
        I do not feel like writing. Hoping
        that this will find you all
        well and that I can soon see
        all of you. Remember me to
        all of your kindred and friends

        Quincy July 5. 1813

        Sir

        last night Mr. Marston gave me the inclosed
        six Papers. The original letter from Captain Hoisted
        Hacker to Brown and Vernon, I wish to have returned.
        These Papers are authentic.

        I have found no Man so alive and ardent in promoting
        your and Mr Clark's Views as John Marston, who has spared
        no pains.

        The Captain Simpson mentioned in one of these Papers
        was the first Lieutenant of Captain John Paul Jones
        when he captured the Twenty Gun Ship which he carried
        into Brest in 1778. Simpson's name ought to be more known
        in History than it is. Ask Colonel Jonathan Williams, if
        he differs in Sentiment, I will dispute with him.

        The Mail is at hand and I wish not to miss it.

        John Adams

        Mathew Carey Esquire.

As to the letters, very many of them, from the most distinguished persons of our own country and of Europe, I regret that it is impossible for me to comply with that portion of your request.

        who have sent us these letters

        The papers we would send you,

        Fort Brown Texas
        14 April 1866

        As the arrival & departure of the mails at this place are uncertain & cannot be accurately anticipated, & as my last letter reporting my arrival here was to the dear Minna, I will prepare this for my dear little Agnes in answer to hers of the 11th ult: so that it may be ready on the first conveyance bound to New Orleans & its transmittal out of private. If any public letters may be obliged to write. I cannot answer your question positively as to the days of sailing of the steamers from New Orleans, for that as at this end of the line depends somewhat on the weather, freight &c. But I believe they prefer to sail on Tuesdays, Thursdays & Saturdays. The two lines are now united, & the days of departure are made to accommodate the arrivals of the boats there & here.

        of their organizations, & supplying by tables & analyses what they want in materials. One is a Mrs. Allen, a Phil- who was originally from Louisville, & her husband is in command of Capt. Van Buren's Comp't. She is quite pretty, has two little girls one of whom is a perfect performer & has mastered great difficulties. The other is Mrs. Robinson, wife of Lt. Robinson. She I believe is from Mass. Has a little girl & boy quite young, & has been quite kind to me. The third is Mrs. Langdon, wife of Lt. L. of Capt. Mait's Comp't. She married here in this place. I have seen no little cherubs around their hearth, though there may be some. Notwithstanding their privations, cramped accommodations, annoyances, hopes &c. they seem to be as happy, bright & cheerful. There is their philosophy & others, which all ought to learn & practice. Our blessings so far.

        issued our discomfits that the latter
        as hardly worth considering. Then they
        are so short lived, will soon be
        swallowed up in death & lost forever.
        I have not yet been into the City of
        Brownsville. I purpose returning some
        calls today & can then see what advance
        ment it has made since my visit
        three years since. I have learned
        with regret that the Episcopal Church
        has been closed since the withdrawal
        of the troops last summer, when Mr.
        Papin was called elsewhere. He
        was Chaplain to the Post, & you may
        recollect hearing was very kind to the
        Misses Layton at the death of their father.
        We should have an [illegible] there through
        command. The Presbyterian Church
        continues, & a new Catholic Church
        has been erected since I was here. I
        have only seen it at a distance, as it
        appears to be an imposing edifice. I
        we are invited in this mind the [illegible]

        Dear Sir

        When last I
        consulted Mr. Trelawny about
        the sketch wh. you have an
        engraving of the Burning of Shelley's
        body, he fixed upon one mis-
        taken point - wh. indeed has
        arisen I know not how. There
        are 3 figures towards the fore-
        ground: but the only 2 -

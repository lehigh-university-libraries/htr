        Nathaniel Cutting,

        It is not more than ten minutes since I have read a very extraordinary letter of yours to Mr. Fairfax read to the House of Assembly in this city, the whole of which is false and malicious, evidently done and with much malice and dare to injure me and gratify Nathaniel Fairfax and other of my enemies; you state positively that I pirated Mr. Cutting's rope machine and sold it to you as wholly my own, this is true. I always informed you that Mr. Cutting had made such a machine. I introduced you to him by letter, would a pirate wishing to conceal his fault have done so? I made one from memory with some alterations, the laws of France permitted patents for inventors, you were to give me something for it. I lent you in your distress more than I ever received, but if you had reason to complain of this transaction why not do it to me within the last ten years? You say receiving from Aaron Vail Hitchcock's papers and had them for several months and that you can well believe because

This is malignant in the highest degree and as false as it is base. I now draw a paper of plan of Hutchins until I saw his patent in the office at Washington in 1869, but if I had seen all his papers which he ever had with his specifications and drawings such as I have never seen in the profession of Mr. Huntley they could teach me nothing. Nor Hutchins nothing he was as Thornton said about as mad. I have now seen the collected and united efforts of Layden, Huntley, Thornton, and Delacy with you and to destroy me. I have seen in glaring colours your combined wretchedness and fortunately for me your weakness. The evidence of Hutchins having his own patenting, and although he was mad had no sense but one and that scientific order of a Steamboat and acknowledged his failure. But for I despise your efforts and that of the miserable ephemeral train whom envy and not totally urge on to attack me. What could induce you to enter those ranks of injustice. I cannot conceive. I always treated you with friendship and certainly I have at times relieved your pressing wants, you have stepped forth as my implacable to be my enemy. I accept it as war.

        I am going to Washington tomorrow morning with some hope to get the patent laws so amended as to protect mental property or diminish lawsuits. You will much oblige me by a letter or letters from any of your influential friends where friendly to science and the improvement of your country. I know W.L. Clay, but to Mr. Henry and Dunning an introduction is necessary. I am unwilling not to mention this proper of mine. I will have the pleasure of calling on you this evening.

        Dear Sir

        Paris June 16. 1789

        Since the receipt of your favor of May 21. I have been in daily expectation of receiving from you a particular state of the cost of my profs ca. Mr Paradise wrote me that it was about five guineas, but I know there would still be some additions. The moment you will be so good as to favor me with this information I will remit you a bill for that & the eight guineas I formerly took the liberty of drawing on you for. In addition to this I must give you another piece of trouble: that is to desire Mr Woodmason, on my part, to send me a copying press (such as the one he sent me before) with spare springs, damping boards, damping boxes complete, three ream of copying paper & a stock of inkpowder proportioned to that. This he must direct to me, & send to the care of Mr Garvey in Rouen, sending me a bill of the cost which I will remit immediately, unless he should prefer drawing on me, in which case his draught shall be paid on sight.

        If you have any news from America it will be very acceptable. I have received no journals of Congress of later date than Oct. 10. nor letter from the Office for foreign affairs of later date than January. There is a violent contest arisen here between the king & parliament of Bordeaux. When the papers are public I will send them to you. After my dear Sir

        Yours affectionately

        My dear "Miss Beaux:

        In spite of your prohibition I do answer your letter, and I return the clippings, for you must be proud of them. It was a fine thing to have a man willing to act as your brother-in-law has acted. It is the kind of thing that is particularly pleasant to me to come across, for, my dear Miss Beaux, I so often see what is mean and sordid in our life that I like to have the good deeds called to my attention too.

        With all thanks,

        Sincerely yours,

        Theodore Roosevelt

Capt. Dustin informs me that the number of men at Johnston will be increased to between thirty and forty in a few days, so that they will want high six barrels for the next month's supply. Lt. Frost the commanding officer at that post writes me he should be glad of having some fresh meat if it can be obtained, as he has had nothing but salt provisions for two months. I have made a purchase of 50 barrels (Corn at 45 barrels) have bought no beef as yet but expect in a few days I shall be able to get some as I have a man to look out for such

        State of the Camp, 2nd Brigade, March 8th 1863

        Dear Cousin,

        I take this opportunity of writing, to let you know that I have not forgotten you. This leaves me well, to gather with the balance of Co. I. The health of our army is very good. I have not heard of a death in our regiment since the battle of Fredericksburg only it was that was killed by the falling of a tree in the 8th Ia Regt. I have not much news to write to you though I feel as if it was my duty to send you a few lines since it has pleased the good & wise ruler of all things to call our beloved Francis from the hardships of this cruel war. He was a good man & one that was beloved by all the company. I never heard a word speak of him in any way than to say that he was a perfect soldier. Though he fell bravely at his post his loss was mourned & regretted by all the company & his impetuous with his friends whose bonds of nature had him dear to them & though we give him up we still retain a hope that he is now high up in heaven. I have had several relations in this wicked war & they have nearly all part away in this early day. I had a brother & a brother in law killed in Tennessee. I have been a witness to death in all its horrors since I have been a soldier in this troublesome war. I have been on the battle field & have seen men fall on my right & left. I have heard the groans of the wounded & dying & heard them call for help & beg for water at mid nights & many hours & even then assistance is impossible by the poor unhappy hearers.

      providerresponse: There is many things that makes war unpleasant. Death in its natural state has no horrors but in battle there is no certainty in the fate or doom of any person. There a man may be shot all to pieces by the murderous shells or he may be slightly wounded & then be sent to a hospital & there he falls in to the hands of those that care not whether he lives or dies. There he is neglected & left to bear his sufferings when there is no kind friend near to soothe his fevered brain or drive away the gloom that rushes over his sinking spirit & threats to sink him beneath the waves of existence. Hundreds of our brave soldiers have parted from their life almost for want of attention. I had a brother who was wounded at the battle of Shiloh in Tennessee & he fell in to the hands of the enemy & there & there I suppose it was horrible. It has pleased the divine ruler that I have spared to the present time though my time now may be growing short & now for aught I know it is near. I am end but as all other soldiers I have a hope that I may see the end of this wicked war & again see our country in peace & prosperity. Times are very hard here about now we get very scant rations only 1/4 pound of bacon & 1/2 pound of flour to the man per day but still I never hear a man grumble we are all content & are now reminded of the fate of this war. The men are all in fine spirits some have a hope that the war is now almost at an end but as for myself the night is as dark now as it ever was bin since the Southern Confederacy went down.

      providerresponse: There is great rumor of a revolution in the west some still look for foreign intervention but I think that we have got our bark to steer alone. The north threatens us with overwhelming force & say they will subjugate us in 6 months in spite of foreign intervention. But I have long been accustomed to their threats & boasting. It does not alarm me in the least. It is possible for them to drive us from every point & greatly increase our oppression but when they say that they will subjugate us they know not what they say for that is a matter of impossibility. They may exterminate us but they never will conquer us. Lizzie I fear you may think that I am trying to make a display of my oratorical powers but I hope you will pardon me for such lengthening speeches as I am fond of long letters. My self written straight at the moment I always hate for them to open my letters & expect them to see something & then be disappointed as to try to tell them something in my broken & stammering way. I know you have heard of our position this winter we have had a very moderate season except a few very cold days & some snow storms. There has been ice here this winter thick enough for men to skate upon & I witnessed the first skating in my history this winter. It was quite a novel to me. The snow fell but the first day we have moved 2 times since the winter set in. We are now at the third camp that we have built very inferior winter quarters at & just as we would get them so that we were comfortable in them we would have to break up & move to another camp. We have been forty times fooled for this winter the way of blankets

        Sir

        Last night Mr Marston gave me the inclosed Six Papers. The original Letter from Captain Hoisted Hacker to Brown and Vernon, I wish to have returned. These Papers are authentic.

        I have found no Man So alive and ardent in promoting your and Mr Clarks Views as John Marston; who has spared no pains.

        The Captain Simpson mentioned in one of these Papers was the First Lieutenant of Captain John Paul Jones when he captured the Twenty Gun Ship which he carried into Brest, in 1778. Simpsons name ought to be more known in History than it is. Ask Colonel Jonathan Williams, if he differs in Sentiment, I will dispute with him.

        The Mail is at hand and, and I wish not to miss it.

        14 April 1860

        As the Animal Department of the mails at this place cannot be accurately anticipated, I as my last letter respecting any arrival here was to the dear Mrs. I in answer to hers of the 11th, so that it may be ready in the first Conveyance to New Orleans & its transmittal sent forward by any public letters I may be obliged to write. I cannot answer your question positively as to the days of sailing of the steamers from New Orleans, in that as on this end of the line depends somewhat on the weather, freight, etc. But I believe they purpose to sail on Tuesdays, Thursdays & Saturdays. The two lines are now united & the days of departure are made to accommodate the Convenience of the Boats & their Heavings.

        Of the requirements, supplying by taste & neatness what they cannot in materials. The is a Mr. Gillett a ship Ins originally from Louisiana. The husband is in Command of Capt. Sam Jones (Pump). She is quite pretty, has two little girls one yet an infant, has spirit & purpose a lot of money for miles. The other is Mr. Robinson, wife of St. Robinson. She believes is from Snaps. Has a little girl by quite young, has been quite kind to me. The third is Mr. Langdon, wife of St. L. a Classmate of Curtis. He married here in this place. I have seen no little children around them, health, though there may be some - something standing their situations, cramped accommodations, summers, hopes & they seem to be happy, bright & cheerful. There is the philosophing in that which all ought to be made practice. God blessings so far

        I am glad that you have sent me death of Nelson Stayd, though I believe it was sent in mere duty to him. The fact that he has lived so long, and seen years of his life spent, must have been years of misery to him. I trust he is now at rest where he is, not where you are. You must express my sympathy to the family when I can do without renewing the sad remembrance of their loss. I am sure they must have had a hard time in the absence of all your services. I hope you had a quantity of work done for your mother, the leaves all disposed of, the garden arranged, and all her things placed where she could find them. I fear her anxiety for the advancement of her operations, the apprehension of their suffering in her absence, may have diminished the pleasure of her visit to the White House. This though is the fate of all good housewives. I have some young ones around me that are busy in their way. Among them, I cannot help regretting the loss of life that has been given to them.

        Anyway, I think it includes the origin that the pain in your eyes may result from the condition of your teeth, not that it will make the pain less, but that it may admit of a cure. I should have been better pleased if you could have told me that the pain had disappeared. But I must have a great deal of patience in this matter, as a great deal of waiting upon events. Above all, we must have great trust in the merciful providence of that Great God, that never loses sight of a faithful friend. I am glad you saw Mr. Smith. I am obliged to him for his remembrances. I had great pleasure in my interview with him. He handed me a letter from your husband, which I read with great pain. I will never forget them. I hope the war of life has them quietly in its end. I cannot help regretting the loss of life that has been given to them. I cannot help regretting the loss of life that has been given to them.

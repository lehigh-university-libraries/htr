        #17 copy
        Trenton Jan. 28. 1815
        Nathaniel Cutting Esq It is not more than ten minutes since
        I have heard a very extraordinary letter of yours to Mr
        Fairfax read to the House of Assembly, in this city, the
        whole of which is false and malignant, evidently done
        and with much exactness and care to injure me and
        gratify Thornton Fairfax and other of my ignorant
        enemies; you state positively that I pirated Mr
        Cartwright's rope machine and sold it to you as
        wholly my own, this is untrue. I always informed
        you that Mr Cartwright had made such a machine
        I introduced you to him by letter, would a pirate
        wishing to conceal his fault have done so? I
        made one from memory with some alterations,
        the laws of France permitted patents for imported
        inventions, you were to give me something for it.
        I lent you in your distress more than I ever
        received, but if you had reason to complain of
        this transaction why not do it to me within the
        last ten years? You say I received from Aaron
        Vail Fitch's papers and had them for several
        months and that you can well believe it because

        if I pirated one machine, why not pirate another and
        would use Fitch's combinations when I felt that no one
        living could detect the plagiarism. This is malignant in the
        highest degree and as false as it is base. I never saw a
        Paper or Plan of Fitch's until I saw his patent in the
        office at Washington in 1807, but if I had seen all his
        Papers which he ever had with his specifications and
        drawings such as I have never seen in the possession of Mr
        Fairfax they could teach me nothing. For Fitch knew
        nothing, he was as        Thornton and about as mad – I
        have now seen the collected and united efforts of Ogden.
        Fairfax, Thornton and Delacy with your aid to destroy
        me – I have seen in glaring colours your combined
        wickedness and fortunately for me your weakness,
        the evidence of Fitch his own ranting and confessions
        he was mad had no science not one exact scientific idea
        of a Steamboat and acknowledges his failure But Sir
        I despise your efforts and that of the miserable
        ephemeral train whom envy and not talents urge on to
        attack me – What could induce you to enter those ranks
        of injustice I cannot conceive. I always treated you
        with friendship and certainly I have at times relieved
        your pressing wants, you have stepped forward unpro-
        voked to be my enemy. I accept the war. I defy
        you or any living being to stain my character with

        August 14, 1905.

        My dear Miss Beaux:

        In spite of your prohibition I do answer your
        letter, and I return the clippings, for you must be
        proud of them. It was a fine thing to have a man
        willing to act as your brother-in-law has acted. It
        is the kind of thing that is particularly pleasant to
        me to come across, for, my dear Miss Beaux, I so often
        see what is mean and sordid in our life that I like
        to have the good deeds called to my attention too.

        With all thanks,

        Sincerely yours,

        Theodore Roosevelt

        Miss Cecilia Beaux,
        East Gloucester, Mass.

        Sir
        last night Mr Marston gave me the inclosed
        Six Papers. The original Letter from Captain Hoisted
        Hacker to Brown and Vernon, I wish to have returned.
        These Papers are authentic.
        I have found no Man so active and ardent in promoting
        Your and Mr Clarks Views as John Marston; who has spared
        no pains.
        The Captain Simpson mentioned in one of these Papers
        was I presume the First Lieutenant of Captain John Paul Jones
        when he captured the Twenty Gun Ship which he carried
        into Brest, in 1778. Simpsons name ought to be more known
        in History than it is. Ask Colonel Jonathan Williams; if
        he differs in Sentiment, I will dispute with him.
        The Mail is at hand and, and I wish not to miss it.

        Your letter, requesting

        sent us, has been received. These
        tributes of respect & affection
        to the memory of my beloved
        husband, have come to us, from
        every quarter of the civilized
        World, and so far as the resolu-
        -tions are concerned, they are
        at your service. As to the
        letters, very many of them,
        from the most distinguished
        persons of our own Country
        and of Europe, I regret that
        it is impossible, for me to
        comply, with that portion, of
        your request - So many persons,

        Miss Harfleurs - She is to be married
        to night to a Clerk in a Store here
        I shall not go if I can avoid it,
        I begin to feel with Aunt Louise that
        in this stage of the world, such things
        ought to Cease. Tell little Julie with
        her bright eyes, she must be married &
        be happy. Annie Carters Lizard is
        named Leigh, not Lee - She will not
        wait long I know for she Can't. Capt
        Evans has arrived on the Stage with
        his bride. I have not seen her, but
        understand she is a Miss Smith
        Mason. What will the father Say to
        that. His Compy is send in the field
        between this & Rio Grande City. She will
        be quite romantic to take the tented
        field. I hope she understands the
        treatment of red bugs & ticks. Remember
        me to all friends. Kiss your Mother brother
        & Sisters for me. Tell Rob his Clasp sent
        for Jul. was elegant. He must attend to
        his writing, & learn to write a good hand, or
        he will be ashamed to write to his Sweet heart
        some of these days. I have a
        great many things to say to you

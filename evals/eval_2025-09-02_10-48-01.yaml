        mation I will remit you a bill for that V the eight guiness
        I formerly took the liberty of drawing on you for. in addition
        to this I must give non another peice of trouble : that is to den.
        mr Woodmason, on may part, to send me a copying prefs (such
        as the one he sent me before) with spare springs, camping books, das
        my boxes complete, three ream of copying paper & a stock of ink pows
        - her proportioned to that. This he must direct to me, & send to
        the care of my Garvey in Rouen , sending me a bill of the cost
        which I will remit immediately, unless he should prefer drawing
        on me, in which case his drought shall be paid on right.
        If you have any news from america it will be very acceptable
        I have received no journals of Congress of later date than Oct.10. nor

        My dear Miss Beaux:
        In spite of your prohibition I do answer your
        letter, and I return the clippings, for you must be
        proud of them.
        It was a fine thing to have a man
        willing to act as your brother-in-law has acted. It
        is the kind of thing that is particularly pleasant to
        me to come across, for, my dear Miss Beaux, I so often
        see what is mean and sordid in our life that I like
        to have the good deeds called to my attention too.
        With all thanks,
        Sincerely yours,

        last night Mr Marston gave me the inclosed
        Six Papers. The original Letter from Captain Hoisted
        Hacker to Brown and Pormon, I wish to have returned.
        These Papers are authentic.
        I have found no Man So active and ardent in promoting
        your and Mr Clarks Views as John Marston; who has pared
        no pours.
        The captain Simpson mentioned in one of These Papers
        was the First Lieutenant of Captain John Paul Jones
        I presume
        when he captured the Twenty Guen Ship which be carried
        into Brest in 1778. Simpsons name ought to be more i nowe
        in History than it is. Ash Colonel Jonathan Williams, if
        he differs in Sentiment, I will dispute with him.

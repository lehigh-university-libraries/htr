        It is not more than ten minutes since
        I have read a very extraordinary letter of yours to Mr
        Fairfax read to the House of Assembly, in this city, the
        whole of which is false and malignant, evidently done
        and with much artifice and care to injure me and
        gratify Thornton Fairfax and other of my ignorant
        enemies: you state positively, that I pirated Mr
        Cartwright's rope machine and sold it to you as
        wholly my own, this is untrue. I always informed
        you that Mr Cartwright had made such a machine
        I introduced you to him by letter, would a private
        wishing to conceal his fault, have done so! I
        made one from memory with some alterations,
        the laws of France permitted patents for imports,
        inventions, you were to give me something for it,
        I lent you in your distress more than I ever
        received, but if you had reason to complain of
        this transaction why not do it to me within the
        last ten years? You say I received from Aaron
        Vail Fitch's papers and had them for several
        months and that you can well believe it, because

        Dear Sir Paris June 16. 1786.

        Since the receipt of your favor of May 21. I have been in
        daily expectation of receiving from you a particular state of the
        cost of my press &c. mr Paradise wrote me that it was about
        five guineas, but I knew there would still be some additions.
        The moment you will be so good as to favor me with this infor-
        -mation I will remit you a bill for that & the eight guineas
        I formerly took the liberty of drawing on you for. in addition
        to this I must give you another piece of trouble: That is to desire
        mr Woodmason, on my part, to send me a copying press (such
        as the one he sent me before) with spare springs, damping books, damp-
        -ing boxes complete, Three ream of copying paper & a stock of inkpow-
        -der proportioned to that. This he must direct to me, & send to
        the care of mr Garvey in Rouen, sending me a bill of the cost.
        Which I will remit immediately, unless he should prefer drawing
        on me, in which case his draught shall be paid on sight.
        If you have any news from America it will be very acceptable.
        I have received no journals of Congress of later date than Oct. 10. nor
        letter from the office for foreign affairs of later date than January.
        There is a violent contest arisen here between the king & parliament of
        Bordeaux. When the papers are public I will send them to you. Adieu

        My dear Miss Beaux:

        In spite of your prohibition I do answer your
        letter, and I return the clippings, for you must be
        proud of them. It was a fine thing to have a man
        willing to act as your brother-in-law has acted. It
        is the kind of thing that is particularly pleasant to
        me to come across, for, my dear Miss Beaux, I so often
        see what is mean and sordid in our life that I like
        to have the good deeds called to my attention too.

        With all thanks,

        Sincerely yours,

        Theodore Roosevelt

        Miss Cecilia Beaux,

        State of the Camp Hays's Brigade March the 8th 1863
        Dear Cousin,
        I take this opportunity of
        writing you a few lines to let you know that I have not
        forgotten you this leaves me well to gather with the ballance of
        Co I the health of our army is very good I have not heard of a
        death in our regiment since the battle of Fredericks Burg only a
        Man that was killed by the falling of a tree in the 8th La Regt
        I have not much news to wright to you though I see as if it was my
        duty to send you a few lines since it has pleased the good & wise ruler
        of all things to call our beloved Francis from the hard ship of this cruel
        war he was a good man & one that was beloved by all the company
        I never heard a man speak of him in any other way than to say that
        he was a perfect Gentleman though he fell bravely & at his post
        his loss was much regretted by all the company & we impatize with
        his friends whose bonds of nature hold him dear to them
        & though we give him up we still retain a hope that he
        is now high up in heaven I have had several relations
        in this wicked war & they have nearly all past away in this
        early day I had a Brother & a Brother in law killed in Tennasse
        I have bin a witness to death in all its terrors since I have
        bin a soldier in this troublesome war I have bin on the
        battle field & have seen men fall on my right & left I have
        heard the prayers of the wounded & dying & heard them call
        for help & beg for water at mid night & many hours & even then
        asistence to them was impossible by their happy hearers.

        There is many things that makes war unpleasant Death
        in its natural state has no horrors but in battle there is no
        certainty in the fate or doom of any person. There a man may
        bee shot all to pieces by the murderous shells or he may bee
        slightly wounded & then bee sent to a hospital & there he falls
        in to the hands of those that cares not whether he lives or dies
        There he is neglected & left to bare his sufferings when there is no
        kind friend near to soothe his fevered brain or drive a way the
        gloom that rushes over his sinking spirit & threatens to sink
        him beneath the waves of existance. hundreds of our brave soldiers
        have part from this life. Nearly for want of attention I had a
        a Brother who was wounded at the battle of Shiloh in Tennesse &
        he fell in to the hands of the enemy & died there & there
        is no one that knew the torture of his head though
        well might I suppose it was horable
        It has pleased the divine ruler that I bee spared to the
        present time though my time now may bee growing short
        & now for aught I know it's near to an end but as all other
        soldiers I have a hope that I may see the end of this wicked
        war & again see our country in peace & prosperity
        Times are very hard here about now we get very scant rations
        only ¼ pound of bacon & ¼ pound of flower to the man per day
        but still I never hear a man grumble or are all content
        & are now resigned to the fate of this war
        The men are all in fine spirits some have a hope that the war
        is now almost at an end but as for my self the night is as
        dark now as it ever has bin since the sun of our happy country
        went down

        There is great Rumors of a Desolation in the west some
        Still looks for foreign intervention but I think that we have
        got our back to stear at home The North threatens us with
        over whelming force & say they will subjugate us in 6 months
        in spite of foreign intervention but I have long bin accustomed
        to yankey threats & boasting it does not allarm me in the least
        it is posable for them to drive us from every point & greatly
        increase our oppression but when they say that they will
        subjugate us they know not what they say for that is a mere
        matter of impossibility They may exterminate us but they never
        will conquer well Lizzie I fear you may think that I am trying to
        make a display of my retoricle powers but I hope you will
        pardon me for speaking at lengthly speak I am fond of long
        letters my self when I write & expect to always have

        & then be disappointed so I try to tell them something in
        my broken & stammering way. I recon you have heard
        of our position this winter we have had a very moderate Season
        except a few very coald days & some snow storms there has
        bin ice here this winter thick enough for men to skate upon
        & I witnessed the first skating in my history this winter. & it
        was quite a novel to me The snow fell about 1 1/2 feet deep we have
        moved 2 Times since the winter set in we are now at the third
        camp that we have build very inferior winterquarters at
        & just as we would get them so that we were comfortable in them
        we would have to break up & move to another camp we have
        bin poorly provided for this winter in the way of blankets

        Sir
        Last night Mr Marston gave me the inclosed
        Six Papers. The original Letter from Captain Hoisted
        Hacker & Brown and Vernon, I wish to have returned.
        These Papers are authentic.
        I have found no Man so active and ardent in promoting
        your and Mr Clarks Views as John Marston; who has spared
        no pains.
        The Captain Simpson mentioned in one of these Papers
        was the First Lieutenant of Captain John Paul Jones
        when he captured the Twenty Gun Ship which he carried
        into Brest, in 1778. Simpsons name ought to be more known
        in History than it is. Ask Colonel Jonathan Williams, if
        he differs in Sentiment, I will dispute with him.
        The Mail is at hand and, and I wish not to miss it.

        Autograph Letter from
        Mrs Lincoln to J. R. Bartlett

        Chicago - Nov 27th -65.

        Hon John R. Bartlett:
        Sir:
        Your letter, requesting
        the resolutions and letters of condolence
        sent us, has been received. These
        tributes of respect & affection
        to the memory of my beloved
        husband, have come to us, from
        every quarter of the civilized
        World, and so far as the resolu-
        -tions are concerned, they are
        at your service. As to the
        letters, very many of them,
        from the most distinguished
        persons of our own country
        and of Europe, I regret that
        it is impossible for me to
        comply, with that portion, of
        your request - So many persons,

        Who have sent us these letters
        of Condolence, it would be con-
        sidered offensive. Otherwise I
        Should like to oblige you —
        The papers, we would send you,
        are so numerous, that it would
        be impossible, to copy them.
        ourselves, you will be pleased to
        write and advise, what is best
        to be done, with them. Awaiting
        your reply, I remain.

        of their acquaintances, & supplying by
        taste & neatness what they want in
        materials – One is a Mr. Gillem, a Miss
        Innes originally from Gloucester. Her husband
        is in Command of Capt. Sam. Innes
        Camp. She is quite pretty, has two
        little girls one yet in arms, has just
        performed a long march of over 400
        miles. The other is Mr. Robinson
        wife of St. Robinson, she I believe
        is from Mass. Has a little quite boy
        quite young, & has been quite kind to
        me. The third is Mr. Langdon, wife
        of St. L. a classmate of Curtis. He
        married her in this place. I have
        seen no little Chunks around their
        hearth, though there may be some –
        notwithstanding their privations,
        cramped accommodations, annoyings, losses
        &. they seem to be happy, light &
        Cheerful. There is true philosophy
        in that, which all ought to learn
        & practice. Our blessings so far

        As the annual departure of
        the mails at this place are uncertain
        & cannot be accurately anticipated,
        & as my last letter reporting my arrival
        here was to the dear Mum, I will
        prepare this for my dear little Agnes
        in answer to hers of the 11th Ult., so
        that it may be ready for the first
        Conveyance to New Orleans & its
        transmittal and prevented by any
        public letters I may be obliged to
        write. I cannot answer your
        question positively as to the days of
        sailing of the steamers from New
        Orleans, for that as on this end of the
        line depends somewhat on the
        weather, freight &c. But I believe
        they propose to sail on Tuesdays,
        thursdays & Saturdays. The two lines
        are now united, & the days of departure
        are made to accommodate the business
        of the boats & their business.

        I am glad that you have seen L.
        Maynard & that he inclines to the
        opinion that the pain in your eyes may
        result from the condition of your teeth,
        but that it will make the pain less,
        but that it may admit of a more
        manifest remedy. I should have
        been better pleased if you could have
        told me that the pain had departed.
        But we must have a great deal of
        patience in this world, & a great deal
        of waiting upon events. Above all we
        must have great trust in the merciful
        providence of that great God that
        never loses light of a sparrows falls to
        us. I am glad you saw Mr & Mrs
        Smith &c. I am obliged to her
        for her remembrances. I had great
        pleasure in my intercourse with
        her husband & herself at West Point
        & will never forget them. I hope the
        river of life bears them gently on to sea
        face. I cannot help regretting the

        death of Wilson Lloyd, though I believe
        it was sent in mercy to him. The last
        years of his life must have been years of
        misery to him. I trust he is now at
        rest & peace. You must express my
        sympathy to the family when it can be
        done without renewing the sad remembrance
        of their loss. You young people must
        have had a fine time in the absence of
        all your Seniors. I hope you had a
        quantity of work done for your Mother,
        the leaves all disposed of, the garden
        arranged & all her things placed
        where she could find them. I fear
        her anxiety for the advancement of her
        operations, & the apprehension of their
        suffering in her absence, may have
        diminished the pleasure of her
        visit to the White House. This though
        is the fate of all good housewives.

        Sir It is not more than ten minutes since I have read a very extraordinary letter of yours to Mr. Halifax read to the House of assembly in this city, the whole of which is false and malignantly evidently done and with much spitefulness and care to injure me and gratify Thornton Halifax and Mr. H. my rival and enemies: you state positively, that I privately Mr. Carbuncle's rope machine and sold it you as wholly my own, this is untrue. I always informed you that Mr. Carbuncle had made such a machine I introduced you to him by letter, would a pirate wishing to conceal his faults have done so? I made one from memory with some alterations, the laws of France permitted patents for inferior inventions, you were to give me something for it. I lent you in your distress more than I have received, but if you had reason to complain of this transaction why not do it to me within the last ten years? You say I received from Aaron Paul Wichers papers and had them for several months and that you can well believing because

        if Spiritualists are machine, why not private another and would use Kirch's combination which I felt that we were twins could defeat the plagiarism. This is malignant to the highest degree and as false as it is base. I never saw a paper or plan of Kirch's until I saw his patent in the Office at Washington in 1869, but if I had seen all the papers which he ever had with his specifications and drawings such as I have never seen in the possession of Mr. Hanify, they could teach me nothing. For Kirch knew nothing, he was as _____ therein she about as much - I have now seen the collected and united efforts of Ogden, Hanify, Kirsch... and Delacy with your aid to destroy me - I have seen in alarming colours your combined wickedness and fortunately for me your weakness. The evidence of Kirch before his own Kandor and ourselves he was much had no device, just one crude scientific idea of a Steam book and acknowledges his failure. But for I despise your efforts and that of the miserable ephemeral bean whom envy and not talent urges onto attack me. What could induce you to enter into this rank of mystery I cannot conceive. I always treated you with friendship and certainly I have at times believed your pressing wants, you have stopped forward (impoverished) to be my enemy. I accept the war, I defy you or any lying being to stain my character with

        The visible text in this aged document includes:

        **At the top:**
        - "Lehigh" (in red text)
        - "15 K 516"

        **In the center (cursive handwriting):**
        The handwriting appears to be an address or inscription in what looks like old script, but due to the cursive style and image quality, the exact text is difficult to read with certainty. It appears to contain multiple lines of text written diagonally across the center of the document.

        **Other elements:**
        - Two red wax seals visible on the left and right sides
        - Various aging marks and stains throughout the document

        Note: The cursive text in the center is quite faded and written in an old style that makes precise transcription challenging without specialized historical document expertise.

        Dear Sir                                                        Paris June 16. 1780

        Since the receipt of your favor of May 21. I have been in daily expectation of receiving from you a particular state of the cost of my press &c. mr Paradise wrote me that it was about five guineas, but I knew there would still be some additions. The moment you will be so good as to favor me with this information I will remit you a bill for that & the eight guineas I formerly took the liberty of drawing on you for. in addition to this I must give you another piece of trouble: that is to desire mr Woodmason, on my part, to send me a copying press (such as the one he sent me before) with spare springs, damping bodys, drying boxes complete, three ream of copying paper & a slack of indian paper proportioned to that. This he must direct to me & send to the care of mr Garvey in Rouen, sending me a bill of the cost. This I will remit immediately, unless he should prefer a drawing on me, in which case his draught shall be paid on sight.

        If you have any news from America it will be very acceptable. I have received no journals of Congress of later date than Oct. 10. nor letter from the office for foreign affairs of later date than January. There is a violent contest arisen here between the king & parliament of Bourdeaux. When the papers are public I will send them to you. Adieu my dear Sir                                         yours affectionately

        Oyster Bay, N.Y.,
        August 14, 1905.

        My dear Miss Beaux:

        In spite of your prohibition I do answer your letter, and I return the clippings, for you must be proud of them. It was a fine thing to have a man willing to act as your brother-in-law has acted. It is the kind of thing that is particularly pleasant to me to come across, for, my dear Miss Beaux, I so often see what is mean and sordid in our life that I like to have the good deeds called to my attention too.

        With all thanks,

        Sincerely yours,

        Theodore Roosevelt

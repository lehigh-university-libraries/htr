        Nathaniel Cutting Esq.

        Sir, It is not more than ten minutes since
        I have heard a very extraordinary letter of yours to Mr.
        Fairfax read to the House of Assembly in this city, the
        whole of which is false and malignant, evidently done
        and with premeditation and care to injure me and
        gratify Horton Fairfax and other of my generous
        enemies; you state positively that I private the
        Cartwright’s fire machine and sold it to you as
        wholly my own, this is untrue. I always informed
        you that Mr. Cartwright had made such a machine
        I introduced you to him by letter, would a private
        wishing to conceal his fraud, have done so? I
        made one from memory with some alterations,
        the laws of France permitted patents for imported
        inventions, you were to give me something for it,
        I lent you in your distress more than I ever
        received, but if you had reason to complain of
        this transaction why not do it to me within the
        last two years? You say I received from Aaron
        Vail Fitch’s glasses and had them for several
        months and that you can well believe it because,

        or letter to any of your influential friends
        who are friendly to science and the
        improvement of our country. I know

        You will please not to mention
        this project of mine, I will have

        Dear Sir

        Paris June 16. 1786

        Since the receipt of your favor of May 21. I have been in daily expectation of receiving from you a particular state of the cost of my press &c. mr Paradise wrote me that it was about five guineas, but I knew there would still be some addition. the moment you will be so good as to favor me with this information I will remit you a bill for that & the eight guineas I formerly took the liberty of drawing on you for. in addition to this I must give you another piece of trouble. that is to desire mr Woodmason, on my part, to send me a copying press (such as the one he sent me before) with spare springs, dampning books, drying boxes complete, three ream of copying paper & a stock of inkpowder proportioned to that. this he must direct to me & send to the care of mr Garvey in Rouen, sending me a bill of the cost which I will remit immediately, unless he should prefer drawing on me, in which case his draught shall be paid on sight. if you have any news from America it will be very acceptable. I have received no journals of Congress of later date than Oct. 10. nor letter from the office for foreign affairs of later date than January. there is a violent contest arisen here between the king & parliament of Bourdeaux. their papers are public. I will send them to you. Adieu my dear Sir

        Yours affectionately,

        Th: Jefferson

        Oyster Bay, N.Y.,
        August 14, 1905.

        My dear Miss Beaux:

        In spite of your prohibition I do answer your letter, and I return the clippings, for you must be proud of them. It was a fine thing to have a man willing to act as your brother-in-law has acted. It is the kind of thing that is particularly pleasant to me to come across, for, my dear Miss Beaux, I so often see what is mean and sordid in our life that I like to have the good deeds called to my attention too.

        With all thanks,

        Sincerely yours,

        Theodore Roosevelt

        Miss Cecilia Beaux,
        East Gloucester, Mass.

        I shall be under the necessity of sending
        on some Provisions to Johnstown this week, for
        the Ensuing Month, which obliges me to request
        you will please forward me on some Beef as
        soon as possible as I have not more on hand
        than to serve this Post to the Close of the Month.

        Capt. Dayton informs me that the Number of
        Men at Johnstown will be increased to between
        thirty and forty in a few days, so that they
        will want Beef via Canada, the next Month
        supply. Lt. Frost the Commanding Officer at
        that Post writes me he should be glad of having
        some fresh Meat if it can be obtained, as he has
        had nothing but salt Provisions for two Months.

        I have made a purchase of 50 Bushells Corn
        at 4/9 Bushells have bought no Hay as yet
        but expect in a few days I shall be able to get
        some as I have a Man to look out for such

        State of Va Camp Winder's Brigade March the 8th 1863

        Dear Cousin

        I take this opportunity of writing you a few lines to let you know that I have not forgotten you. This leaves me well & I hope when this comes to hand it will find you in the same good health. I have not heard of a death in our regiment since the battle of Fredericksburg only a man that was killed by the falling of a tree. I think that is a happy time. I have not mutch to write to you at present. I was on duty to bring wood to our line since it has snowed the past & we were under orders to leave. I called Colonel Francis from the hardships of the current & he was a good man & one that was beloved by all the company. I never heard a man speak of him in any other way than to say he was a perfect man though he was nearly 40 yrs of age, his coffin was met & escorted by all the company & we sympathize with his friends at home. Friends of nature hold him dear to them & though we give him up we still stand & hope that he is in a high seat in heaven. I had several relations in this wicked war & they have nearly all past away in it. Early departed fallen either in North or South. I have one killed in Tennessee & I have five writing to death in one of its wars. I have a son a soldier in this troublesome war. I have him on the battle field & I have seen men fallen on the right & left & I have heard the prayer of the wounded & dying. I have seen them call for help & help wanted at midnight & in the hour & seen them assisted to their impossible by the happy hours.

      openairesponse: There is many things that makes war unpleasant. Death in its natural state has no horrors but in battle there is no certainty in the fate or doom of any person. There a man may be shot all to pieces by the murderous shells or he may be slightly wounded & then be sent to a hospital & there be neglected & die. That covers not whether he lives or dies there is no neglect & if he has his suffering when there is no kind friend near to soothe his fevered brain or drive away the gloom that hovers over his sinking spirit & death & thick night of eternal existance hundreds of brave soldiers have past from this life & nearly as many have been lost in the war. I was talking to a Tennesee soldier who was wounded at the evening & died there & there he fell in the course of his career though well might I suppose it was honorable. It has pleased the divine ruler that I be spared to the present time though my time now may be growing short & now for aught I know its near at an end but as a soldier I have hoped that I may see the end of this wicked war & again see our country in peace & prosperity. Times are very hard here & but now ought my heart rather only 4 pounds of bacon & 1 pound of flour is the war today but still I never hear a man grumble & we are all content & are now resigned to the fate of this war. The men are all in good spirits some have hoped that the war is near about at an end but for myself the night is as dark now as it has been since the war. I am happy & contented & await the event. Amen.

        Sir

        last night Mr. Marston gave me the inclosed
        six Papers. The original letter from Captain Hoisted
        Hacker to Brown and Vernon, I wish to have returned.
        These Papers are authentic.

        I have found no Man so alive and ardent in promoting
        your and Mr Clark's Views as John Marston, who has spared
        no pains.

        The Captain Simpson mentioned in one of these Papers
        was the first Lieutenant of Captain John Paul Jones
        when he captured the Twenty Gun Ship which he carried
        into Brest in 1778. Simpson's name ought to be more known
        in History than it is. Ask Colonel Jonathan Williams, if
        he differs in Sentiment, I will dispute with him.

        The Mail is at hand and I wish not to miss it.

        John Adams

        Mathew Carrey Esquire.

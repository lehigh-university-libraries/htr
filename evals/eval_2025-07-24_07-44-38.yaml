I always informed you that Mr. Cartwright had made such a machine I introduced you to him by letter, would a private wishing to conceal his fraud, have done so? I made one from memory with some alterations, the laws of France permitted patents for improvements, you were to give me something for it, I lent you in your distress more than I ever received, but if you had reason to complain of this transaction why not do it to me within the last two years? You say I received from Aaron Vail Fitch’s papers and had them for several months and that you can well believe it because, \n\n---"

This is malignant to the highest degree and as false as it is base. I never saw a paper of Mr. Fitch until I saw his papers in the office at Washington in 1807, but if I had seen all his papers, which he ever had, with his specifications and drawings such as I have never seen in the possession of Mr. Harford, they could lead me nothing. Mr. Fitch never wrote, he was mad. Thornton who at one time I have seen the collected and united efforts of Ogden, Harford, Thornton and Delacy with your aid to destroy me. I have seen in fancy colors your embrions & workshops and fortunately for me your mockups, the evidence of that, his own writing and confession he was mad had no science not one exact scientific idea of a steamboat and acknowledged his failure. But for I despise your efforts and those of the miserable ephemeral train whom envy and malice urge on to attack me. What could induce you to enter those ranks of injustice I cannot conceive. I always treated you with friendship and certainly I have at times relieved your pressing wants, you have stepped forth and improved to be my enemy. I accept the war.

        My dear Sir

        I am going to Washington tomorrow morning
        With some hope to get the patent laws so minded
        as to protect mental property or diminish
        lawsuits, you will much oblige me by a letter
        or letter to any of your influential friends
        who are friendly to science and the
        improvement of our country. I know
        Mr. Lloyd, but to Mr. Denney and
        Quincy an introduction is necessary
        If you will please not to mention
        this project of mine, I will have
        the pleasure of calling on you this
        evening Respectfully your most
        obedient
        Rob. Fulton

        THE WHITE HOUSE.
        WASHINGTON.

        Oyster Bay, N.Y.,
        August 14, 1905.

        **Body of the Letter:**

        My dear Miss Beaux:

        In spite of your prohibition I do answer your letter, and I return the clippings, for you must be proud of them. It was a fine thing to have a man willing to act as your brother-in-law has acted. It is the kind of thing that is particularly pleasant to me to come across, for, my dear Miss Beaux, I so often see what is mean and sordid in our life that I like to have the good deeds called to my attention too.

        With all thanks,

        Sincerely yours,

        *Theodore Roosevelt*

        **Bottom of the Letter:**

        Miss Cecilia Beaux,
        East Gloucester, Mass.

        Enclosures.

        Dear Mother,

        Yours of the 11th inst. was received yesterday and I was glad to hear from you all once more and hear that you were well. Grandmother is not well and I am afraid she is not to soon for I cannot get any medicine down here for them now. My bowels are some better but in a bad condition yet and I have that old disease in my back it is so lame that it hurts me to move and I went to the Doctor yesterday and he had nothing for me and told me to wait it will get well. Mother, I cannot rest any thing on it hope it might through me, and am going very weak.

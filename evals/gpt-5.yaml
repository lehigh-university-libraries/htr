        Nathaniel Cutting Esq
        Sir,
        It is not more than ten minutes since I have heard a very extraordinary letter of yours, to Mr Fairfax, read to the House of assembly, in this city, the whole of which is false and malignant, evidently done and with much artifice and care to injure me and gratify Horton Fairfax and other of my personal enemies; you state positive, that I pirated Mr Cartwright’s [—] machine and sold it to you as wholly my own, this is untrue. I always informed you that Mr Cartwright had made such a machine; I introduced you to him by letter, would a pirate wishing to conceal his fraud have done so? I made one from memory with some alterations, the laws of [illegible] permitted patents for improvements; you were to give me something for it; I lent you in your distress more than I ever received; but if you had reason to complain of this transaction why not do it to me within the last ten years? You say I received from Aaron Vail [illegible] papers and had them for several months and that you can well believe it, because [text continues off page].

        Thanks for your patience—here’s a best‑effort transcription of the handwritten page. Words I can’t confidently read are marked with [illegible] or [?].

        if I pirated one machine why not pirate another, and would not Fitch’s [condemnation/contrivance?] who [I/you] feel that no man living could detect the plagiarism. This is malignant to the highest degree and as false as it is base. I never saw a paper of John Fitch until I saw his patent in the office at Washington in 1807; but if I had seen all his papers which he ever had with his specifications and drawings, such as I have never seen in the possession of Mr. [illegible], they could teach me nothing. For Fitch knew nothing—he was, as Mr. Thornton [was], about as mad. I have seen the collected and united efforts of [Godon/Gordon?], [Harfax/Harvey?] Thornton and Delacy, with your aid, to destroy me. I have seen in [glaring/gaudy] colours your unbounded [wickedness/weakness], and fortunately for me your [weakness/meanness]; the evidence of which, in his own writing and confessions, he was mad, had no science, not one exalted scientific idea of a Steamboat, and acknowledged his failure. But I despise your efforts and those of the miserable splenetic train whose envy and ill‑nature urge on to attack me. What could induce you to enter those ranks of injustice I cannot conceive. I always treated you with friendship, and certainly I have at times relieved your pressing wants; you have stepped forth my professed [friend/words?] to be my enemy. I accept the war; I defy you or any living being to stain my character with

        If you want, I can try another pass focusing on specific lines you care about, or apply image enhancement to reduce the [illegible] spots.

        Dear Sir

        Paris June 16. 1789.

        Since the receipt of your favor of May 21. I have been in daily expectation of receiving from you a particular state of the cost of my press &c. mr Paradise wrote me that it was about five guineas, but I knew there would still be some addition.

        The moment you will be so good as to favor me with this information I will remit you a bill for that & the eight guineas I formerly took the liberty of drawing on you for. In addition to this I must give you another piece of trouble: that is to desire mr Woodmason, on my part, to send me a copying press (such as the one he sent me before) with spare springs, damping books, drying boxes complete, three reams of copying paper & a stock of inkpowder proportioned to that. This he must direct to me & send to the care of mr Garvey in Rouen, sending me a bill of the cost which I will remit immediately, unless he should prefer drawing on me, in which case his draught shall be paid on sight.

        If you have any news from America it will be very acceptable. I have received no journals of Congress of later date than Oct. 10. nor letter from the Office for foreign affairs of later date than January. There is a violent contest arisen here between the king & parliament of Bourdeaux. When the papers are public I will send them to you. Adieu.

        my dear Sir

        Yours affectionately,

It was a fine thing to have a man willing to act as your brother-in-law has acted. It is the kind of thing that is particularly pleasant to me to come across, for, my dear Miss Beaux, I so often see what is mean and sordid in our life that I like to have the good deeds called to my attention too.

        State of Va Camp Hays’s Brigade March the 8th 1863

        Dear Cousin

        I take this opportunity of writing you a few lines to let you know that I have not forgotten you. This leaves me well and getting well with the balance of Co. G. The health in camp is very good. I never [heard?] of a death in our regiment since the battle of Fredericksburg, only a man that was killed by the falling of a tree the other day. I have not much to write at present, so it was my duty to write you a line to let you know it. [I was?] [illegible].

        We have lost one of [our best?] [Colonel?] Francis from the hard [steps/stripes?] of this cruel war. He was a good officer and one that was beloved by all the company, and men respected him, each of [us/them?] [more?] dear to [us/them?] than [illegible]. Though he is gone the man, though he [illegible] beauty of [his?] past, his loss was much regretted by all the company and [regiment?], with [tears?] in [their?] eyes. [Friends?] of nature hold him dear to them, and though we give him up we still stand and hope that we may meet again in heaven. I had several relations in this wicked war; they was nearly all cast away in its early days of battle. [Either?] [2 or 3?] brothers was [mortally?] wounded and one killed in Tennessee. I have bin a witness to death in all its forms since I have bin a soldier in this troublesome war. I have bin on the battle field and have seen men fall on my right and left. I have heard the prayers of the wounded and dying. I have heard them call for help, and help wanted at midnight hours, [even?] then assistance to them impossible by the [happy?] [Savior?].

Death in its natural state has no horror, but in battle there is no certainty in the fate or doom of any person. There a man may bee shot all to pieces by the murderous shells or he may bee slightly wounded & then bee sent to a hospital & there falls into the hands [of those] that cares not whether he lives or dies. There he is neglected & left to bear his suffering when there is no kind friend near to sooth his pains & drive away the gloom that hangs over his sinking spirits, [health?] and kind [words?] from those at a distance hundreds of miles [illegible].

It has pleased the divine ruler that I bee spared to the present time though my time now may bee growing short & now for aught I know it’s near at hand, but as a soldier I hope that I may see the end of this wicked war & again see our country in peace & prosperity. Times are very hard here but now we get my heart rations—only 1/2 pound of bacon & 1/2 pound of flour to the man per day—but still I never hear a man grumble; we are all content & are now resigned to the fate of this war. The men are all in fine spirits; some has a hope that the war is almost at an end, but for myself last night I was as dark now as I [have been] since the [war began].

        There is great rumors of a [illegible] in the west some
        still look for foreign intervention but I think that we have

        in spite of foreign intervention but I have long bin accustom

        it is posible for them to drive us from every point & greatly

        will conquer us [illegible] I fear you may think I am trying to

        Quincy July 5: 1813

        Sir

        Last night Mr Marston gave me the inclosed six Papers. The original letter from Captain Hoysted Hacker to Brown and Vernon, I wish to have returned.

        These Papers are authentic.

        I have found no Man so active and ardent in promoting your and Mr Clarks Views as John Marston, who has spared no pains.

        The Captain Simpson mentioned in one of these Papers was the first Lieutenant of Captain John Paul Jones when he captured the Twenty Gun Ship which he carried into Brest in 1778. Simpson’s name ought to be more known in history than it is. Ask Colonel Jonathan Williams; if he differs in Sentiment, I will dispute with him.

        The Mail is at hand and I wish not to miss it.

        14 April 1860

        As the arrival & departure of
        the mails at this place are uncertain
        I cannot be accurately anticipated; as
        my last letter reporting my arrival
        here was to the last minute. I will
        prepare this for my dear little Agnes
        in answer to hers of the 11th Ulto; so
        that it may be ready for the first
        conveyance to New Orleans & its
        transmittal out of [illegible]. If any public
        letters [I] may be obliged to write— I cannot
        answer your question positively as to the days
        of sailing of the steamers from New
        Orleans, for that as on this end of the
        line depends somewhat on the weather,
        freights &c— But I believe they prefer
        to sail on tuesdays, thursdays & saturdays—
        The hours here are uncertain; the days
        of departure are made to accommodate
        the convenience of the boats & their [illegible].

        taste & industry what they want in
        materials. One is a Mrs [Allen/Allan?], a
        [illegible], who was originally from
        Louisville Ky. Her husband is in command
        of Capt Van Dorn’s Compy. She is quite
        pretty, has two little girls, [one?] yet in arms,
        hospitable & pleasant—has [illegible] smiles.
        The other is Mrs Robinson wife of
        Lt Robinson— She I believe is from Mass.
        Has a little girl & boy quite young, &
        has been quite kind to me— The third is
        Mrs [Sargent/Sanger], wife of Lt [illegible] of
        [illegible] Regts. She remains here in this
        place. I have seen no little cherubs around
        their hearths, though there may be some—
        notwithstanding their privations, cramped
        accommodations, annoy[ances], hopes &c,
        they seem to be happy, hopeful, cheerful—
        There is true philosophy in [illegible],
        which all might be glad to learn &
        practice. Our blessings so far [illegible].

I should have been better pleased if you could have told me that the pain had departed, but we must have a good deal of patience in this world — a great deal of waiting upon events. Above all we must have great trust in the wise Providence that governs the universe, and [we] look at present troubles in the [rosy] light of [prospects] before us. I am glad you saw Mr & Mrs Smith — I am obliged to her for her remembrance. I had great pleasure in my interview with her husband & herself at West Point — will never forget them — I hope the wind of life bears them gently in its favor. I cannot help regretting the

You young people must have had a fine time in the absence of all your seniors. I hope you had a quantity of work done for your mother, the leaves all disposed of, the garden arranged, and all her things placed where she could find them. I fear her anxiety for the [advancement] of your operations, and the apprehension of their suffering in her absence, may have diminished the pleasure of her visit to the White House.

        [We ?] [view/meet with ?] our disappointments that the latter
        are hardly worth considering. Then they
        are so short lived, will so soon be

        ment it has made since my visit
        three years since. I have learned
        with regret that the Episcopal Church
        has been closed since the withdrawal
        of the troops last summer, when Mr.
        Papineau was called elsewhere. He
        was Chaplain to the Post, & you may
        recollect he was very kind to the
        Misses Taylor at the death of their father,

        The Presbyterian Church
        continues, & a new Catholic Church
        has been erected since I was here. I
        have only seen it at a distance, as it
        appears to be an imposing edifice. I

        - ought to cease. Tell little Louisa with
        - her bright eyes, she must be a good girl &
        - be happy. Annie Carter’s [illegible] is

        If you can provide a higher‑resolution scan (300–600 dpi), better lighting/contrast, or separate images of each direction of writing, I can give a much more complete and accurate transcription.

        Dear Sir,

        When last I
        consulted Mr. Trelawny about
        the sketch wh. you have an
        engraving of—the Burning of Shelley’s
        body, he fixed upon one mis-
        taken point—wh. indeed has
        arisen I know not how. There
        are 3 figures towards the fore-
        ground: but the only 2—
        Trelawny (upwards of 6 feet high)

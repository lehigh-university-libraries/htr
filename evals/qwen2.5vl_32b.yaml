        **Hentaw Jan. 28, 1815**

        Nathaniel Cutting

        It is not more than ten minutes since I have heard a very extraordinary letter of yours to Mr. Harifasas read to the House of Assembly in this city, the whole of which is false and malicious, evidently done and with much spite and bare to injure me and gratify Shotutaw Kairsfay and other of my own enemies; you state positively, that I pirated Mr. Carkburnight's proper machine and sold it to you as wholly my own, which is untrue. I always informed you that Mr. Carkburnight had made such a machine I introduced you to him by letter, would a pirate wish to conceal his fault? I have done so. I made one from memory with some alterations, the laws of France permitted patents for imported inventions, you were to give me something for it. I lent you my obstructions more than Pleacer received, but if you had reason to complain of the transaction, why not do it to me within the last ten years? You say I received from Aaron Vail Pitcho's paper and had them for several months, and that you can well believe because

        The text appears to be a handwritten letter dated January 28, 1815, addressed to Nathaniel Cutting. The content discusses a dispute over a machine, accusations of piracy, and a misunderstanding regarding patents and inventions. The handwriting is somewhat difficult to decipher in places, but the above transcription captures the essence of the letter.

        as follows:

        ```
        if I pirated one machine, why not pirate another, and
        would use Fulton's combinations, when I felt that no one
        living could detect the plagiarism. This is malignant in the
        highest degree and is false as it is bare. I never saw a
        paper or plan of Fulton until I saw his patent in the
        office at Washington in 1807, but if I had seen all his
        papers which he ever had with him, specifications, and
        drawings such as I have never seen in the possession of Mr.
        Henderson, they could teach me nothing. Mr. Fulton knew
        nothing, he was an ignoramus. I have known him about as well
        as I have known any one else, and I have seen the collected
        and united efforts of Lyden,
        Faulkner, Horwitz, and Delacey with your aid to destroy
        me. I have seen in glaring colours your combined
        wickedness and fatuity for me. Your weakness, the evidence
        of Fulton, bankrupt, his own counting and confession, he
        was mad, had no service and one generally scientific idea
        of a steamboat, and acknowledges his failure. But for
        I deplore your efforts and that of the miserable
        ephemeral train train when away and not lost, urge on to
        attack me. What could induce you to enter those ranks
        of injustice I cannot conceive. I always treated you
        with friendship, and certainly I have at times believed
        your pressing wants, you have stepped forward unprovoked
        to be my enemy. I accept the war, I defy
        you or any living being to stain my character with.

        My dear Sir,

        I am going to Washington tomorrow morning with some hope to get the patent laws amended as to protect mental property or diminish lawsuits. You will much oblige me by a letter in letter, way of your influential friends who are friendly to science and the improvements of your county. I know W. W. Lloyd, but to W. Deming and Quinn an introduction is necessary. If you will please not to mention this property of mine, I will have the pleasure of calling on you in the evening. Respectfully yours,

        Walter Rob. Fulton

        The text appears to be slightly repetitive and contains some inconsistencies, which might be due to the nature of the handwriting or the scanning process. The main content is about a trip to Washington to seek amendments to patent laws and a request for introductions to influential people.

        Selmontednesday April 22 1782

        I shall be under the necessity of sending
        on some Provisions to Johnstown this week, for
        the ensuing Month, which obliges me to request
        you will please forward me on some Business
        soon as possible as I have not common hand
        than than to send this Post to the close of the Months.
        Capt. Duxton informs me that the Number of
        Men at Johnstown will be increased to between
        thirty and forty in a few days, so that they
        will want high six Bushels of the next Months
        Supply. D. Scott the Commanding Officer at
        that Post writes to me he should be glad having
        some fresh Meat if it can be obtained, as he has
        had nothing but salt Provisions for two Months.
        I have made a purchase of 50 Bushels Corn
        at 4s. per Bushel, but have bought no Hay as yet
        but expect in a few days I shall be able to get
        some us. I have a Man to look out for milk

        **State of the Camp Wayside Brigade March 2nd to 6th, 1863**

        Dear Cousin,

        Take this opportunity of writing a few lines to let you know that I have not forgotten you. I trust you are well and gathered with the balance of the company. Is the health of our army very good? I have not heard of a death in our regiment since the battle of Fredericksburg. Only one man that was killed by the falling of a tree in the attack kept. I have not much time to write as you think. It seems as if it was my duty to send you a few lines since it has learned the good news of all things. It calls on behalf of Francis from the hard steps of this crowd, was he was a good man, a man that was beloved by all the company. Never heard a man speak of him in any way than to say that he was a perfect gentleman. Though he fell bravely at his post, his loss was much regretted by all the company. We are compelled with his friends whose bonds of nature held him dear to them. Though we give him his air, we still retain hope that he is now high up in heaven. I have had several relations in this wicked war. They have nearly all parted away in the early days. I had a brother in the line who was killed in Tennessee. I have been a witness to death in all its horror since I have been a soldier in this troublesome war. I have been on the battlefield and have seen men fall on my right and left. I have heard the prayers of the wounded and dying. I have heard them call for help and beg for water at midnight, many hours. It is impossible by these happy hearers.

        There is many things that makes war unparant Death in its natural state has no horrors but in battle there is no certainty in the fate or doom of any person thus a man may be shot all to pieces by the murderous shells or he may be slightly wounded and then he is sent to a hospital and there he falls in the hands of those that care not whether he lives or dies then he is neglected and left to bear his suffering when there is no kind friend near to pour his poisoned brain or drive away the gloom that rushes over his thinking spirit threatening to think him beneath the waves of existence. Hundreds of our brave soldiers have part from this life merely for want of attention. I had a brother who was wounded at the battle of Fortska in Tennessee and he fell in the hands of the enemy and died there and there are none that have the torture of his dead though well might I suppose I was horrible. It has pleased the divine ruler that I have been spared to the present time though my time now may be growing short and now for aught I know is near to an end but as all other soldiers I have a hope that I may be the end of this wicked war again and know my country in peace and prosperity. Times are very hard but now we get very heart harbor only 24 pounds of bacon and 1/2 pound of flower a day but still I never hear a man grumble we are all content and are now refined to the fate of this war. The men are all in fine spirits some have a hope that the war is now almost at an end but as for myself the night is as dark now now as it was when I came here.

        There is great rumors of a dissolution in the west some still looks for foreign intervention but I think that we have got our bark to steer along the north threats are with our overwhelming forces & say they will subjugate us in 6 months in spite of foreign intervention but I have long since accustomed to Yankee threats & boasting it does not alarm me in the least it is possible for them to drive us from every point & greatly increase our oppression but when when they say that they will subjugate us they know not what they say for that is a matter of impossibility. They may determine to us but they never will conquer well sir I fear you may think that I am trying to make a display of my oratorical powers but I hope you will pardon me for my lengthy speech. I am fond of writing letters to myself when I write it always takes for them to open my letter & expect when there is something & then be disappointed so I try to tell them something in my broken & stammering way. Green you have heard of our portion this winter we have had a very moderate season except a few very cold days & some snow there has been no ice here this winter thick enough for men to beat upon & I witnessed the first skating in my history this winter & it was quite a novel to me the snow fell a little the first day we have moved 2 times since the winter began we are now at the third camp that we have built very inferior winter quarters at just as we would get them then so that we were comfortable in them we would have to break up & move to another camp we have now nine poorly framed sleds for this winter the way of blankets

        **Quincy July 5. 1513**

        Sir,

        last night Mr. Marston gave me the enclosed Six Papers. The original letter from Captain Hoisted Hackor to Brown and Vernon, I wish to have returned. These Papers are authentic.

        I have found no Man So advise and ardent in promoting your and Mr. Clark's Views as John Manston; who has spared no pains.

        The Captain Simpson mentioned in one of these Papers was the First Lieutenant of Captain John Paul Jones when he captured the Twenty Gun Ship which he carried into Brest, in 1778. Simpson's name ought to be more known in History than it is. Ask Colonel Jonathan Williams, if he differs in Sentiment, I will dispute with him.

        The Mail is at hand and, and I wish not to miss it.

        **Mrs. Lincoln to J.R. Batlett**

        Chicago, Nov. 27th, 65.

        Hon. John R. Batlett:

        Sir:

        Your letter, requesting the resolutions and letters of condolence sent us, has been received. These tributes of respect and affection to the memory of my beloved husband, have come to us from every quarter of the civilized world, and so far as the resolutions are concerned, they are at your service. As to the letters, very many of them, from the most distinguished persons of our own country and of Europe, I regret that it is impossible for me to comply with that portion of your request — to many of them.

        ---

        This text appears to be a handwritten letter from Mary Todd Lincoln to Hon. John R. Batlett, dated November 27, 1865, in Chicago.

        who have sent us this letter of condolence, it would be too offensive otherwise. Should you like to oblige us, the papers we would send you are so numerous, that it would be impossible to copy them ourselves. You will be pleased to write and advise what it is best to be done with them. Awaiting your reply, I remain,

        Very respectfully,

        Mary Lincoln
